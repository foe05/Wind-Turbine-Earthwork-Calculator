description=Optimizes wind turbine platform height by calculating optimal cut/fill volumes from DXF crane pad designs and DEM data
version=2.0.0
author=Wind Energy Site Planning
email=info@example.com

about=This QGIS Processing plugin calculates the optimal height for wind turbine crane pads in hilly terrain. It imports DXF files with crane pad outlines, downloads elevation data from hoehendaten.de API, and calculates the platform height that minimizes earthwork (cut and fill volumes). The plugin generates terrain cross-sections, volume calculations, and professional HTML reports.

    Key Features:
    - DXF file import for crane pad geometries
    - Automatic DEM download from hoehendaten.de API
    - Height optimization (minimize earthwork)
    - Terrain cross-section generation
    - Professional HTML reports with maps and profiles
    - GeoPackage output with all layers
